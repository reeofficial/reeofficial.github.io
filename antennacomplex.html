75 Terrawatts of energy is used daily by the plants for photosynthesis.  Even though this is a big number its just  .1% of total energy received from the sun daily,166 petawatts. But still this is more than 4 times the annual consumption of energy by humans, 16 terrawatts.

Antenna complex within the leaves of the plant are responsible for extracting energy from the sunlight. These molecular nanoantennas work on the principle of resonance energy transfer. In simple terms each section of antenna extracts energy from a particular wavelength of light and pass on the rest. Other sections of antenna the extract energy from the portion of light they accept and pass on the rest.

Although these molecules are called "antenna complex" they are actually organic semiconductors. The antenna complex molecules obey the principle of optoelectronic reciprocity and fluoresce in the red and blue portions when excited by UV light.

They absorb only those frequencies of light that fall within their band gap. The proof can be found in their flourescence spectrum. Excitation by higher energy wavelengths of light leads to electronic excitaion,charge separation,recombination and finally emission of visible light. It is this visible light emission indicates a band gap which falls in the range that is typical of semiconductors.

The term antenna refers to how the energy is transferred between distributed molecules within the leaf each set of which absorbs from different wavelengths of light. Because sun continous broadband source of emission no single uniform material (like silicon) can absorb from the entire spectrum. At best they can only absorb a tiny subset of energy (like red in silicon). To create a broadband absorber a conjuction of diffrent materials is needed. Nature understood this long ago and has successfully managed to design systems overcome this limitaion. Antenna complex provide a ready made biological template that can serve as an insipartion for the design of such complex systems in future.

Understanding the properties of antenna complex within the leaves can help us design better organic semiconductors for use in computing,lighting and energy applications.


The following paper analyzes the physical properties -- electronic structure ,band gap , optical properties,geometry of the antenna complex molecules and describes how light is absorbed ,energy is transferred and charge is separated in the photosynthetic molecules with >90% quantum efficiency.
