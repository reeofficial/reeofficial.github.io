Can concentrated solar energy be used

Absolutely. Concentrated solar power (CSP) can be used to synthesize new materials  especially those which are formed at high tempratures. It can be used for sintering,melting,vapor deposition processes. In short any manufacturing process or step that uses heat can benefit from CSP. We are talking about tempratures that easily cross 1500C with a concentrating lens and some designs even crossing 2000 degrees celcius.

<p>

CSP lens is just about as efficent, when all variables are factored in, as an industrial laser. And because sun is a broadband energy source,as opposed to an industrial  laser which usually radiates at only one wavelength CSP has an added advantage of activating surface under treatment. There's a greater chance for the material to absorb high energy solar wavelengths better than laser where it has to work with only one wavelngth,usually lower energy. This leads to an improved energy efficiency.

Although this idea is not new it has gained importance due to the current impetus  on finding clean manufacturing technologies.

"Tremendous advances have been made in the development of new 
materials capable of working under  extreme conditions possible due 
to the development of Materials Surface Engineering. The utilisation of techniques based on 
high density energy beams (laser, plasma, electron beam or arc lamps) in surface 
modification and metallic material treatment allow for the creation of non-equilibrium 
microstructures which can be used to manufacture materials with higher resistance to 
corrosion, high temperature oxidation and wear, among other properties. 
All of these techniques suffer from low overall energy efficiency.  While it is true that the energy density 
obtained through a laser is three to four magnitudes greater than that which is obtained by 
solar energy concentration facilities, Flamant (Flamant et al. 1999) have carried out a 
comparison of the overall energy and the capital costs of laser, plasma and solar systems 
and came to the conclusion that solar concentrating systems offer unique 
opportunities for high temperature transformation and creation of materials from both the 
technical and economic points of view. 
The benifits are not limited to synthesis alone.  The use of concentrated solar energy could also lower the cost of high 
temperature experiments.
</p>

 Combined with the wide array of superficial modifications that 
can be carried out at solar facilities, there are numerous other advantages to using this 
energy source. The growing (and increasingly necessary) trend towards the use of 
renewable clean energy sources, which do not contribute to the progressive deterioration of 
the environment, is one compelling argument. Solar furnaces are also excellent research 
tools for increasing scientific knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the processes 
generated at high temperatures under non-equilibrium conditions. </p>

<p>

If, in addition, the solar 
concentration is carried out using a Fresnel lens, several other positive factors come into 
play: facility costs are lowered, adjustments and modifications are easy to carry out, overall 
costs are kept low, and the structure is easy to build, which makes the use of this kind of 
lens highly attractive for research, given its possible industrial applications. 
These are the reasons that justify the scientific community’s growing interest in researching 
the possible uses of highly concentrated solar energy in the field of materials. But this 
interest is not new. At the end of the 18th century, Lavoisier (Garg, 1987) constructed a
concentrator based on a lens system designed to achieve the melting point temperature for 
platinum (1773ºC). But it was not until the twentieth century that the full range of 
possibilities of this energy source and its applications to the processing and modification of 
materials started to be explored in depth. The first great inventor was Felix Trombe who 
transformed German parabolic searchlights used for anti-aerial defence during WW II into a 
solar concentrator. Using this device he was able to obtain the high temperatures needed to 
carry out various chemical and metallurgic experiments involving the fusion and 
purification of ceramics (Chaudron 1973). In 1949 he was able to melt brass resting in the 
focal area of a double reflection solar furnace which he constructed using a heliostat or flat 
mirror and a parabolic concentrator (50kW Solar Furnace of Mont-Louis, France). But his 
greatest achievement was the construction of the largest solar furnace that currently exists in 
the world, which can generate 100kW of power. The “Felix Trombe Solar Furnace Centre” is 
part of the Institute of Processes, Materials and Solar Energy (PROMES-CNRS) and is a 
leader in research on materials and processes. 
Another of the main figures in the use of solar energy in the materials field and specifically 
in the treatment and surface modification of metallic materials is Prof. A.J. Vázquez of 
CENIM-CSIC. His research in this field started at the beginning of the 1990’s, using the 
facilities at the Almería Solar Plant (Vazquez & Damborenea, 1990). His role in encouraging 
different research groups carrying out work in material science to experiment with this new 
solar technology has also been very important. 
The initial studies with CSE at the ETSII-UCLM involved characterising a Fresnel lens with a 
diameter of 900 mm, for its use as a solar concentrator (Ferriere et al. 2004). The 
characterisation indicated that the lens concentrated direct solar radiation by 2644 times, 
which meant that on a clear day with an irradiance of 1kW/m2 the density of the focal area 
would be 264.4 W/cm2 . This value is much lower than this obtained with other 
techniques based on high density beams, but is sufficiently high to carry out a large number 
of processes on the materials, and even a fusion of their surfaces.

The investigations carried out to date include processes involving the sintering of metallic 
alloys, surface treatment of steel and cast irons, cladding of stainless steel and intermetallic 
compound, high temperature nitriding of titanium alloys and NiAl intermetallic coating 
processing through a SHS reaction (Self-propagating high temperature synthesis). 
 In the studies we have 
conducted to date we have seen a clear activating effect in CSE which results in treatment 
times that are shorter, and which add to the efficiency of the process as well as increase in 
the quality of the modified surface. This is due to, among other factors, the properties of 
solar radiation. The visible solar spectrum extends from the wavelengths between 400 and 
700 nm where most metals present greater absorbance, making the processes more energy 
efficient. 

Although the use of solar energy for industrial applications suffers a disadvantage due to its 
intermittent nature, it should be noted that according to Gineste (Gineste et al. 1999) in 
Odeillo where the Felix Trombe Solar Furnace Centre is located, the peak value of the direct 
normal irradiation is 1100 W.m-2 and it exceeds 700 W.m-2 during 1600 hours per year and 
1000 W.m-2 during only 200 hours per year. In Ciudad Real, Spain, at latitude 38°, the 
availability of the solar energy reported by the Spanish “Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia” (Font Tullot, 1984), is 11% higher than in Odeillo. Direct solar radiation 
measured with a pyrheliometer between 19 June and 31 August, 2009, at the ETSII-UCLM 
(Ciudad Real, Spain) registered values higher than 950W.m-2 for 20% of the days and higher 
than 800 W.m-2 for 97% of the days. The peak value has been attained in this period was 976 
W.cm-2 .

Concentrated solar energy (CSE) represents an alternative to other types of energy beams 
for treating and modifying the surfaces of metallic materials. This technique is 
breaking new ground in the use  non-contaminating and environmentally acceptable 
technologies for processes involving the surface modification of metallic materials at high 
temperatures. It is also increasing scientific knowledge about the mechanisms involved 
when processing materials at high temperatures under non-equilibrium conditions. In the 
studies carried out to date, it has been observed that CSE has a clear activator effect, which 
results both in shorter treatment times and therefore, in increased processing efficiency, and 
in improved quality of the modified surface. 
For high-temperature processes, concentrated solar energy has shown to be highly energy 
efficient and also competitive in terms of cost." It is especially suitable for developing countries like
India, which has a high number of sunny days per year. Question is can we develop industrial applications for concentrated solar 
technology,  especially now when energy-efficiency and environmental 
preservation have become top priorities?
