What causes double emission in TADF molecules?

</h1>


</p>

<p>

TADF is a phenomenon that allows excited electrons that would otherwise dissipate energy as heat to emit light in visible frequencies. When electrical energy is applied to materials a distribution of singlet and triplet electrons are created. Singlet electrons can fluoresce triplets can't.  In TADF triplets can absrob surrounding heat and transition to singlet leading to an emission. Now a few things are clear from this

</p>

<p>


1. In a TADF material there will be two sets of emission. First from the normal singlet electrons and then from the triplets that converted to singlet. 



</p>

2. There will be a delay in the second emission. Because it takes some time for triplet electrons to absorb energy and transition to a state where emission is possible. This time is in nanosecond range so it can still be called fluorescence.  But because of the slight delay its called delayed fluorescence. 

</p>

3. The frequency of the delayed fluorescence can either be the same as normal singlet fluorescence or it can be slightly lesser. Usually delayed fluorescence occurs at a lesser frequency. So a single TADF molecule can emit two colors at a time. A higher energy color and a lower energy color. 

</p>

This double emission in TADF has some exciting possibilities of its own. Since each molecule can emit atleast two frequencies it can be used to create efficient , simpler "phosphor free" integrated white light devices. Because the second emission is delayed TADF can be used to design high throughput communication systems that carry data on visible light.
